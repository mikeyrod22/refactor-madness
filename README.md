# Refactor Madness

This challenge begun by cloning the [urban-octo-telegram repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram).

I was tasked with refactoring the existing code to meet certain pre-determined acceptance criteria.

I reorganized CSS rules to appear in a logical order, consolidated duplicate code by elimintating unnecessary classes, corrected 
minor typos in index.html and style.css, and tracked the whole process with multiple git commits.

Here is an image of the mock-up I was provided:
